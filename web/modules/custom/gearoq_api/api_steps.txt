I have a custom module gearoq_api

I need to create a POST resource for json api which will create a content with type: social_content_proposition.
Fields used in this content are:

- body - text area
- field_social_media: Entity reference
Reference type: Taxonomy term
Vocabulary: Social Media

- field_update_in_airtable
Boolean



All needed modules are enabled.

My user for basic authentication is "api" with password set to 123.

Crete a resource with routing /api/create/social-proposition

Prepare a custom form to test this POST action. Keep in mind that we will have more endpoints to test so make
a structure for furure endpounts to test - proper routing and links for test forms. In testing form use api user nam, not currently logged user name. We need test if "api"
use is working properly.

This api will be used by external service to create a content so "api" user need to be able use this endpoint.

At the end give me an example json to send which will create an example content.
